#TODO:

This project could use some love. Almost all the code needs to be reformatted.

This todo list is in no particular order and if you find something that you think needs doing but is not on this list feel free to do it anyways!

-Rewrite the JS in OOP format

-Rewrite the PHP in OOP format

-Generally organize the code base

-Improve the UI layout by reorganizing the options and auto hiding some features until their precursors are selected. For instance the 'FILE TYPE' option should show up only if 'SEARCH FOR' is set to 'ONLY FILES OF TYPE'

-Add some in-app help or tool tips to explain the purpose of the options

-Add to and improve word lists 

-Implement option for changing the user-agent string that is passed to cURL
